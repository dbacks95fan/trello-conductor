The evaluator handoff is being changed from a local filesystem dependency to an immutable Git-revision handoff. The work is constrained to the orchestrator and evaluator repositories; the Coding Agent and MealFlow repositories remain untouched.

The host Node 24 test runner cannot start `tsx` because `uv_os_get_passwd` returns an ENOMEM error. The same suites run successfully in the Dockerized Node 20 runtime used by the evaluator.

Added a third webhook trigger: a card entering **Spec & Design** now runs the
Spec & Design Agent. New modules `workflow/specRequestFromCard.ts` (card
projection + intent-backlog fetch + integrity check), `workflow/specWorkspace.ts`
(creates `work/<intent-id>` worktree, freezes `intent.md`, hashes it),
`specDesignAgent/runSpecDesignAgent.ts` (subprocess), `workflow/specRouting.ts`
(result → board move). `server.ts` and `workflow.ts` gained a parallel queue.

Decisions, all made to follow the agentic-sdlc docs:

- **Local subprocess**, not Docker or a NAS service — the deployment-boundary
  doc allows a local-process worker and it matches `runCodingAgent`.
- **Intent identity** comes from the card's metadata block
  (`work-tracking.md` "Trello card contract"); the **frozen bytes and hash**
  come from `intent-backlog` at the pinned `Intent Commit` via the GitHub
  contents API. Card↔backlog disagreement on id/product/version/status/hash is a
  hard stop with a card comment.
- **The orchestrator does the freeze** (worktree + staged `intent.md` +
  `frozenArtifactSha256`) so the hash precondition is checked Conductor-side
  before the agent runs. The agent re-verifies the bytes as its own gate.
- **`approval` is approximated**: `approvedAt` = frontmatter `frozen_at` or the
  move timestamp; `approvedBy` = the Trello member who moved the card. Flagged
  in the README as needing a real Ready-for-Planning capture later.
- **List names** `Spec & Design` / `Design Review` are env-overridable and
  resolved lazily, so a board without them still starts the existing flow.
- `SPEC_DESIGN_AGENT_CLI` is optional in config; unset → card comment, no crash.

Left alone: the coding/eval half still uses the retired board vocabulary and a
`TARGET_REPO`-committed intent. The two halves don't meet end to end yet — noted
in the README, out of scope here.

Pre-existing unrelated failure still red: `src/runtimeConfig.test.ts` asserts a
POSIX path and fails on Windows (`C:\workspace\...` vs `\workspace\...`). Not
touched.

Later the same day: the Spec & Design Agent must run as a Docker container
deployed to this machine, not as a local subprocess. Two consequences worth
recording, because the second one forced a rewrite:

- `runSpecDesignAgent.ts` now shells `docker run --rm` with the workspace
  bind-mounted at `/work`, replicating the hardening in the agent's own
  `compose.yaml` (read-only rootfs, tmpfs `/tmp`, `HOME=/tmp`, `cap-drop ALL`,
  `no-new-privileges`). `SPEC_DESIGN_AGENT_IMAGE` replaces the CLI command; the
  orchestrator never builds the image. Added a hard timeout that kills the run.
- **`git worktree` cannot work here.** A worktree's `.git` is a link file
  holding an absolute host path into the parent repo's `.git/worktrees/`, which
  does not resolve inside the container — and mounting the parent repo would not
  fix it, because a Windows host path is meaningless to a Linux container.
  `specWorkspace.ts` now makes a full local clone instead: self-contained `.git`,
  all history so `baseCommit` is verifiable offline, and `origin` removed since
  it points at an unreachable host path. This replaced yesterday's worktree
  implementation rather than patching it — the constraint changed, not the code.

`target.workspace` in the request is `/work`, not the host path: the agent
resolves it from inside the container. The request file is written into the
workspace as `spec-design-request.json` and removed after the run.

Tests use a `fake-docker.cjs` fixture standing in for the docker CLI, so unit,
integration, and e2e stay hermetic and offline. A real-daemon run against the
built image is still a deployment-verification step, not something the suite
covers.

Probed the flag set against the real daemon rather than trusting it, and caught
a defect the hermetic tests could never have found: git aborts with **"detected
dubious ownership in repository at '/work'"** when the container's non-root uid
does not own the bind-mounted files. The agent would have died at its first
workspace check, every time. Fixed by passing `safe.directory=/work` plus a
commit identity through `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` / `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_n` /
`GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_n`, which needs neither a writable HOME nor a writable rootfs.
Re-verified against the daemon: status, branch resolution, staging, commit, and
author identity all work under `--read-only` as uid 10001.

Also dropped a redundant `--workdir /app` — the image already sets it. (It first
showed up as a bogus `C:/Program Files/Git/app` because Git Bash rewrote the
path in my manual probe; Node's `spawn` does no such conversion, so it was never
a product bug, just a misleading test artifact.)

Deployed `spec-design-agent:local` to Docker Desktop. Build was blocked by a
transposed base-image tag: `python:3.12-bookworm-slim` does not exist, it is
`python:3.12-slim-bookworm`. (The uv builder tag genuinely is `bookworm-slim` —
astral uses the opposite convention, which is likely how it crept in.)

Ran the image through the orchestrator's real code path against a menuapp clone
with `provider=mock`. Everything on our side worked — mount, safe.directory,
read-only rootfs, request round-trip, result parsing, routing, TARGET_REPO
untouched — and the agent got as far as writing `spec.md` before failing:

    git add -- .agent/work/INT-MF-0042/{intent.md,spec.md,spec-run.json} -> exit 1

Reproduced in isolation: `menuapp/.gitignore:19` ignores `.agent/`, and plain
`git add` refuses ignored paths. `git add --force` stages them. The agent uses
plain `git add`; our `specWorkspace.ts` and the evaluator's `gitHandoff.ts` both
already force. Left the fix to Sobe — either the agent forces, or menuapp stops
ignoring `.agent/work/` — because it is a policy call across his repos, unlike
the Dockerfile tag which had one right answer.

### GitHub from inside the container

Measured before changing anything: **network egress and CA trust already worked**
— the container reads a public repo fine. The only gaps were credentials and a
usable remote. So this was never a networking change.

- `specWorkspace.ts` now *retargets* origin to the target repo's real HTTPS URL
  instead of removing it. Cloning from the local path stays fast and credential
  free, but the clone now carries a remote that resolves identically on the host
  and in the container. Refuses a target repo whose origin is not HTTPS.
- The container gets a `credential.helper` via `GIT_CONFIG_KEY_3`, with the token
  passed by **environment pass-through** (`-e GITHUB_TOKEN`, no `=value`) so it
  never lands in argv, `docker inspect`, or the process list. Verified with a
  bogus token: GitHub answers "Invalid username or token" (credentials sent and
  rejected) rather than "could not read Username" (none sent).
- **The Conductor pushes, not the agent.** `AGENT_ROLES.md` grants the Spec &
  Design Agent no write authority over the product repository, and the evaluator
  handoff already makes the Conductor the component that publishes a branch. The
  agent's own contract is commit-only, so without this step `spec.md` would never
  leave the host and Design Review would have nothing to open.
- `SPEC_DESIGN_GITHUB_TOKEN` lets the container hold a narrower read-only
  credential than the write-capable one the push uses.

A test caught a UX defect worth noting: with no origin at all, `git config --get`
exits non-zero, so the cryptic "Command failed" surfaced instead of the
actionable message. Now tolerated and reported properly.
